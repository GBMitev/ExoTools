This code has a bunch of tools I found I kept rewriting when using ExoMol files. Hope it's useful. 

You can install it by cd-ing into the directory such that ls returns:

**dist exotools** README.md pyproject.toml

and running:

  **$pip install -e .**

The -e is there to allow you to edit the package and then the changes will be visible immediately. 
The "." tells to install the current directory, which you cd'd into. 
Works in linux.
